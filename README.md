# learn-lua
This repository should give you some insight into making your first lua script. And then making a script for fivem!


### 1st we have to learn some basics with lua.
Start making stuff. First we have to get some basics. Look at [this](https://youtu.be/f-v00iiqFOw) video. It will teach you some basics. A great video / series from pasieka. Please actually do what the video shows so you learn by doing not just by looking at the vid!

**IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU UNDERSTAND NORMAL BASIC LUA BEFORE LEARNING FIVEM**
### 2nd we will learn some basics for lua in fivem. This video series is from charleshacks Again a great video series. [Link](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJHKr4HVljNJKVdetugOr1QTpqRSe1Abx&si=-LY76dskg769wlvJ) this links to a full series. Skip to ep2 if you already have a simple fivem server done.
### 3rd we will have to learn how to format shit in fivem. NO WE DO NOT just do functions called fuckme() to start a thread. IF YOU DO THIS GO DO SOMETHING ELSE THAN CODE PLZ
Here is a [link](https://manason.github.io/effective-fivem-lua/) to manason's "tutorial" for better formating and more effective lua creation (especailly for fivem ((( altho it does aply to other places which use lua.))))
### 4th AGAIN charleshacks. his expert series is a great tool for someone who wants to learn about some of those not so much used things in fivem script creation. I urge you to go and look at that! [Link](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJHKr4HVljNIQ4cLZx2pGuFygUDE2-uvp&si=_PKX3QsJZW8d30Oj)
